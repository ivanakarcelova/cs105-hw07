###  Questions  ###

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT: Unlike most assignments, we strongly suggest
interleaving working on the CQs with working on the theory and programming
portions. Specifically, we advise this approach to working on the assignment,
which will roughly follow the flow of concepts covered in lecture:

 -- Work on CQ 1. 
 -- Tackle the theory portion of the assignment (Part A). 
 -- Work on CQs 3 and 4. 
 -- Tackle Part C and begin working on Part D of the programming portion.
 -- Work on CQ 2.
 -- Tackle Part B of the programming portion. 

For question 1, read section 6.3 about how Typed Impcore is extended with
arrays. Skip the paragraphs about array evaluation at the end of section 6.3.2
(from "Array operations expect arrays and integers..." to the end of that
section). 

 1. This question refers to code chunk 348, which shows the cases that have to
    be added to the type checker for Typed Impcore to handle arrays.

    For each case, name the type-system rule that applies.  Each
    answer should be a rule name like Apply or GlobalAssign.

      * The rule for case `| ty (AAT (a, i)) = ...` is: ArrayAt


      * The rule for case `| ty (APUT (a, i, e)) = ...` is: ArrayPut


      * The rule for case `| ty (AMAKE (len, init)) = ...` is: MakeArray
  

      * The rule for case `| ty (ASIZE a) = ...` is: ArraySize


    Now pick one of the rules and explain, in informal English, what
    the rule is supposed to do.

      > ArraySize has type array(𝜏). Given Tuscheme’s types (ksee, phi, rho), 
        Array-Size(e) has type int.

    _This problem is getting you ready for Parts A and C of the homework._

For question 2, read section 6.6.3 on quantified types in Typed μScheme.  Make
sure you read the transcripts in the first couple pages of that section: each
value that has a quantified type (e.g., `length`, `cons`, `car`) is instantiated
later in the transcript, giving you more examples to relate back to the prose.
Here are two important things to keep in mind as you read this section:

-- This section refers to "kinds", which are covered in lecture but not yet in
   any reading; if you want a quick refresher on them, read the first two
   paragraphs of section 6.6.2.

-- Typed uScheme types are written in 4 different ways in the textbook (Ugh...).
   The first 3 have lots of similarities, i.e., they all have some version of
   "forall" written, and type constructors are always written to the left of
   their type arguments. The fourth is funkier:

    (1) The concrete syntax you'd see in a Typed uScheme program (see code chunk
        357b for some examples). For example, a function taking a polymorphic
        list and returning an integer would be written as: 
        
            (forall ['a] ((list 'a) -> int))

    (2) The abstract syntax you'd see in the ML interpreter, i.e., how a Typed
        uScheme type is represented in the interpreter. This syntax is defined
        with an algebraic data type in code chunk 357a, and an example of using
        that syntax to construct a big type is shown at the top of page 381.
        The type of the function mentioned in (1) would be written with this ML
        expression:

            FORALL (["a"], 
                    FUNTY ([CONAPP (TYCON "list", [TYVAR "a"])], 
                           TYCON "int"))

    (3) The abstract syntax you'd see in a kinding rule, which determines the
        kind of a type (see the rules on page 355 and 357). This syntax uses the
        greek letter α ("alpha") with subscripts to denote different type
        variables. The type of the function mentioned in (1) would be written
        with this notation in a kinding rule:

            FORALL(<α>, CONAPP(TYCON(list), TYVAR(α)) →  TYCON(int))

    (4) An "algebraic notation" used to write out types in prose and some
        examples. This one is really annoying because it always puts type
        constructors AFTER the constructor's type arguments, following the
        notation used in ML program's for ML types (e.g., typing [] in the mosml
        interpreter tells you the empty list has type "'a list" instead of 
        "list 'a"). The type of the function from (1) would be written as
        follows:
        
            `∀α . α list → int`


 2. (a) Assume variable `syms` holds a list of symbols (it has type
        `(list sym)`).  What expression do you write to compute its
        length? Pick exactly one of the options below.

        1. `(length syms)`
        2. `((o length sym) syms)`
        3. `((@ length sym) syms)`
        4. `((length sym) syms)`

        > ...your answer here...


    (b) You are given a function `positive?` of type `(int -> bool)`.
        Using the predefined function `o`, which has type
        `(forall ('a 'b 'c) (('b -> 'c) ('a -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'c)))`,
        what code do you write to compose `positive?` with `not`?

        > 
    (c) In testing, we sometimes use a three-argument function `third`
        that ignores its first two arguments and returns its third
        argument.  Such a function has type

            (forall ('a 'b 'c) ('a 'b 'c -> 'c))

        Using a `val` definition, define function `third` (which has the above
        type) in Typed μScheme.  You will need to use both `type-lambda` and
        `lambda`.

        >

    _You are ready to start Part B of the homework._


For the rest of the questions, read section 6.6.5 about typing rules for
expressions and definitions in Typed μScheme. The final part of the section on
type checking refers to some functions that you will be using/implementing in
your code, including the eqType function; read the definition of eqType in code
chunk 370a to learn how two types are checked for equality in the Typed μScheme
interpreter.

 3. For each of the Typed μScheme expressions below, say if it is well typed,
    and if so, **what type it has**.  If the expression is not well typed, say
    what typing rule fails and why.

        ; (a)
        (if #t 1 #f)

        > This expression is not well typed, as it fails the If rule. In this 
        case, e1 is a BOOL. e2 and e3 are expected to be of the same type 𝜏, but
        that is not the case, as e2 is an INT and e3 is a BOOL.

        ; (b)
        (let ([x 1]
              [y 2])
           (+ x y))

        > This experssion is well typed and is of type INT.

        ; (c)
        (lambda ([x : int]) x)

        > This experssion is well typed and is of type INT.

        ; (d)
        (lambda ([x : 'a]) x)

        > This expression is not well typed because under the enviornment kind,
        'a is not well defined. 

        ; (e)
        (type-lambda ['a] (lambda ([x : 'a]) x))

        > This expression is well typed and the type is 'a.
  
    _You are almost ready for Part D._


 4. Writing a type checker amounts to implementing a set of typing inference
    rules. Most of the premises and judgment forms found in Typed μScheme's
    rules already have been implemented with functions provided in the
    `tuscheme.sml` interpreter; a full list of these functions and their
    correspondence to the rules can be found in table 6.4 on page 367. 
    
    For each of the following Typed uScheme expressions, list __all__ the
    functions from the table that you will use to help type check that
    expression, and what you will use that function to do. Use the table and the
    inference rules for the expression form to answer this question.
    
    Here is an example to show what we're looking for:

    To type-check SET(x, e), we will use functions:

      - `typeof`, to recursively typecheck e
      - `find`, to ensure x has a type and to retrieve that type
      - `eqType`, to make sure the type of x and the type of e are equivalent

    (a) To type-check IF(e1, e2, e3), we will use functions:

        - `typeOf`, to recruistively typecheck e1, e2, e3
        - `eqType`, to make sure the type of e2 and the type of e3 are equivalent
        - `eqType`, to make sure the type of e1 and the type of bool are equivalent

    (b) To type-check WHILE(e1, e2), we will use functions:

        - `typeOf`, to recruistively typecheck e1, e2
        - `eqType`, to make sure the type of e1 and the type of bool are equivalent


    (c) To type-check LETX (LET, binds, e), we will use functions: 

        - `typeOf`, to recursively typecheck all bindings in e 
        - `Γ <+> mkEnv`, to bind variables to type in updated environment


    _You are ready for Part D._
